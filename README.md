# amazon-clone-project
This project is a frontend clone of Amazon’s website, developed using pure HTML and CSS. It replicates the look and feel of Amazon’s homepage, product sections, navigation bar, and footer layout. The goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate front-end design skills, layout structuring, and responsive design techniques.
